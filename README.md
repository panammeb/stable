Depict the microbial diversity using a phylogenetic approach

PANAM is a pipeline for depicting the microbial diversity within one or several samples. It implements a phylogenetic
approach for the annotation of 16S and 18S rRNA genes, and is optimized for the processing of large datasets
(Pyrosequencing and Illumina MiSeq runs). PANAM combines the publicly available tools: PANGEA, PANDASEQ,
USEARCH, HMMALIGN and FASTTREE with perl scripts dedicated to (i) cleaning raw sequences, (ii) trimming
profile alignments to fit the studied region and (iii) processing generated phylogenies to describe clades and
phylogenetic diversity indexes.
